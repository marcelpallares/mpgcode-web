# Why to become a Mobile Developer? ðŸ“²

Mobile development has some peculiarities and presents particular challenges that other programming disciplines do not possess, so being aware of them will help you decide whether becoming a mobile developer is the right fit for you and if you should start spending your time learning it.

There are so **many different career paths** out there that a software developer can take.

As a personal preference, *I have always found much more fun to code stuff that finally gets presented as a UI*. I get to see what the result of my code is in a much **more visual and interactive** way than a super-optimized algorithm in a backend lambda function that delivers content 22% faster than its previous implementation.

Iâ€™m not saying thatâ€™s not fun, itâ€™s just not the type of coding I enjoy the most ðŸ˜…

As I prefer to see the output of my code in UI, my preferred software development disciplines are inclined towards **mobile development** and **frontend development**.

I enjoy both of the disciplines and I try to keep myself updated on the latest on both, although I tend to end up always being more engaged with **mobile development** as it offers some particular features:

- Provides a **better user experience** than websites thanks to its implementation using the OS native programming language and the use of its native components and APIs.
- Gives **full access to mobile device capabilities** such as cameras, sensors and OS APIs to handle different system peculiarities as battery saving modes or network signal conditions.
- Handles **offline capabilities** more richly thanks to the use of native local databases, user preferences and client caching systems.
- Offers the ability to **schedule background processes** to handle different scenarios even when the users are not using your app (fetch app data, download newly available media, check geolocation...).
- Mobile **push notifications are more effective** thanks to channel subscriptions, deep-linking policies and user targeting events.
- Massive app market opportunities thanks to **Google Play** and the **App Store**.

Objectively speaking, those are the main advantages of mobile apps. However, subjectively speaking, *the feeling of a native mobile app coded by yourself delivers a lot of joy* (I'm not saying frontend development does not deliver joy, it's just a different one ðŸ˜„).

Picture the following situation: last week you just started coding a new project, and you are on the bus on your way to run some errands. The feeling of checking your app in your own mobile and playing around with its UI, running the different native transitions, making it crash intentionally on the sections you know that are not ready yet, wondering what features are you gonna implement next... Thatâ€™s **truly magic**! I just love it!

## Final thoughts

*Apps are always there for you*, whether you have internet connectivity or not. Even when you have connectivity, they are much faster and lighter than a website thanks to having them installed on your device. That gives them a massive advantage for use cases that otherwise would not be possible to fulfil or that would deliver a worse user experience with a website.

*It's a great moment to become a mobile developer*. The mobile operating systems have matured a lot and their app development tools are much easier to start working with.
