**If you are thinking about becoming a mobile developer, but questions keep coming to you, and you're still not sure about starting to invest your time learning, then this post will help you out.**

Mobile development has some singularities and presents some challenges that other programming disciplines do not possess, and being aware of them will help you make the correct decision.

There are **many different career paths** out there that a software developer can take.

Personally, *I have always found it much more fun to code stuff that finally gets presented as a user interface (UI)*. I get to see the result of my code in a much **more visual and interactive** way than a super-optimized algorithm in a backend lambda function that delivers content 22% faster than its previous implementation.

Iâ€™m not saying thatâ€™s not fun; itâ€™s just not the type of coding I enjoy the most <emoji src='sweat_smile' size={20} />

As I prefer to see the output of my code in UI, my preferred software development disciplines are inclined towards **mobile development** and **frontend development**.

I enjoy both of them, and I try to keep myself updated on the latest on both, although I tend to end up always being more engaged with **mobile development** as it offers some singular features:

- Provides a **better user experience** than websites thanks to its implementation using the OS native programming language and the usage of its native components and APIs.
- Gives **full access to mobile device capabilities** such as cameras, sensors and OS APIs to handle different system peculiarities as battery saving modes or network signal conditions.
- Handles **offline capabilities** more richly thanks to native local databases, user preferences and client caching systems.
- Offers the ability to **schedule background processes** to handle different scenarios even when the users are not using your app (fetch app data, download newly available media, check geolocation...).
- Mobile **push notifications are more effective** thanks to channel subscriptions, deep-linking policies and user targeting events.
- Massive app market opportunities thanks to **Google Play** and the **App Store**.

Objectively speaking, those are the main advantages of mobile apps. However, subjectively speaking, *the feeling of a native mobile app coded by yourself delivers a lot of joy* (I'm not saying frontend development does not deliver joy, it's just a different one <emoji src='smile' />).

Picture the following situation: last week you just started coding a new project, and you are on the bus on your way to run some errands. The feeling of checking your app in your mobile and playing around with its UI, running the different native transitions, making it crash intentionally on the sections you know are not ready yet, wondering what features are you gonna implement next... Thatâ€™s **truly magic**! I love it!

## Takeaways

*Apps are always there for you*, whether you have internet connectivity or not. Even when you have connectivity, they are much faster and lighter than a website due to having them installed on your device. That gives them a massive advantage for use cases that otherwise would not be possible to fulfil, or that would deliver a worse user experience with a website.

*It's a great moment to become a mobile developer*. The mobile operating systems have matured a lot, and app development tools are much easier to start working with.

Do you think mobile development could fit you? I encourage you to try and figure it out yourself!
